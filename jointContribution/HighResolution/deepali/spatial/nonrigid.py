                single transformation, or a separate transformation for each image in the batch, e.g.,
                for group-wise or batched registration. The default is one transformation for all images
                in the batch, or the batch length of the ``params`` tensor if provided.
            params: Initial parameters. If a tensor is given, it is only registered as optimizable module
                parameters when of type ``paddle.nn.Parameter``. When a callable is given instead, it will be

                vector field grid are aligned. Otherwise, the edges of the grid domains are aligned.

                field ``u`` (and ``v`` if applicable) is resized to match the image ``grid`` size. This means that
