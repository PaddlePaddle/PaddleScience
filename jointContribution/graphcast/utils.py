    """Returns relative position features for the edges.

    This function is equivalent to
    `get_relative_position_in_receiver_local_coordinates`, but adapted to work
    with bipartite typed graphs.

    The relative positions will be computed in a rotated space for a local
    coordinate system as defined by the receiver. The relative positions are
    simply obtained by subtracting sender position minues receiver position in
    that local coordinate system after the rotation in R^3.

    Args:
      senders_node_phi: [num_sender_nodes] with polar angles.
      senders_node_theta: [num_sender_nodes] with azimuthal angles.
      senders: [num_edges] with indices into sender nodes.
      receivers_node_phi: [num_sender_nodes] with polar angles.
      receivers_node_theta: [num_sender_nodes] with azimuthal angles.
      receivers: [num_edges] with indices into receiver nodes.
      latitude_local_coordinates: Whether to rotate edges such that in the
        positions are computed such that the receiver is always at latitude 0.
      longitude_local_coordinates: Whether to rotate edges such that in the
        positions are computed such that the receiver is always at longitude 0.

    Returns:
      Array of relative positions in R3 [num_edges, 3]
