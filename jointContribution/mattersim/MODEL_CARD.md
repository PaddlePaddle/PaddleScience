# MatterSim

MatterSim is a large-scale pretrained deep learning model for efficient materials emulations and property predictions.

## Model Details

### Model Description

MatterSim is a deep learning model for general materials design tasks. It supports efficient atomistic simulations at first-principles level and accurate prediction of broad material properties across the periodic table, spanning temperatures from 0 to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 GPa. Out-of-the-box, the model serves as a machine learning force field, and shows remarkable capabilities not only in predicting ground-state material structures and energetics, but also in simulating their behavior under realistic temperatures and pressures. MatterSim also serves as a platform for continuous learning and customization by integrating domain-specific data. The model can be fine-tuned for atomistic simulations at a desired level of theory or for direct structure-to-property predictions with high data efficiency.

Please refer to the [MatterSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967) manuscript for more details on the model.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

To evaluate the model performance, we created the following test sets

- **MPtrj-random-1k:** 1k structures randomly sampled from MPtrj dataset
- **MPtrj-highest-stress-1k:** 1k structures with highest stress magnitude sampled from MPtrj dataset
- **Alexandria-1k:** 1k structures randomly sampled from Alexandria
- **MPF-Alkali-TP:** For detailed description of the generation of the dataset, please refer to the SI of the [MatterSim manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967)
- **MPF-TP:** For detailed description of the generation of the dataset, please refer to the SI of the [MatterSim manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967)
- **Random-TP:** For detailed description of the generation of the dataset, please refer to the SI of the [MatterSim manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967)

We released the test datasets in pickle files and each of them contains the `ase.Atoms` objects. To access the structures and corresponding labels in the datasets, you do use the following snippet to get started,

```python
import pickle
from ase.units import GPa

atoms_list = pickle.load(open("/path/to/datasets.pkl", "rb"))
atoms = atoms_list[0]

print(f"Energy: {atoms.get_potential_energy()} eV")
print(f"Forces: {atoms.get_forces()} eV/A")
print(f"Stress: {atoms.get_stress(voigt=False)} eV/A^3, or {atoms.get_stress(voigt=False)/GPa}")
```

#### Metrics

We evaluate the performance by computing the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of energy (E), forces (F) and stress (S) of each structures within the same dataset. The MAEs are defined as follows,
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{MAE}_E=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^N\frac{1}{N_{at}^{(i)}}|E_i-\tilde{E}_i|" alt="MAE_E equation">
</p>
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{MAE}_F=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N\frac{1}{N_{at}^{(i)}}\sum_{j}^{N^{(i)}_{at}}||F_{ij}-\tilde{F}_{ij}||_2," alt="MAE_F equation">
</p>
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{MAE}_S=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{N}||S_{i}-\tilde{S}_{i}||_2," alt="MAE_S equation">
</p>
where N is the number of structures in the same dataset, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;&space;N_{at}^{(i)}"> is the number of atoms in the i-th structure and E, F and S represent ground-truth energy, forces and stress, respectively.

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model only supports atomistic simulations of materials and molecules. Any attempt and interpretation beyond that should be avoided.
The model does not support generation of new materials as it is designed for materials simulation and property prediction only.
The model is intended for research and experimental purposes. Further testing/development are needed before considering its application in real-world scenarios.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The current model has relatively low accuracy for organic polymeric systems.
Accuracy is inferior to the best (more computationally expensive) methods available.
The model is trained on a specific variant of Density Functional Theory (PBE) that has known limitations across chemical space which will affect accuracy of prediction, such as the ability to simulate highly-correlated systems. (The model can be fine-tuned with higher accuracy data.)
The model does not support all capabilities of some of the latest models such as predicting Born effective charges or simulating a material in an applied electric field.
We have evaluated the model on many examples, but there are many examples that are beyond our available resources to test.

### Recommendations

For any appications related simulations of surfaces, interfaces, and systems with long-range interactions, the results are often qualitatively correct. For quantitative results, the model needs to be fine-tuned.
