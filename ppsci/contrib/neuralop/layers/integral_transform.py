    """Integral Kernel Transform (GNO)
    Computes one of the following:
        (a) \int_{A(x)} k(x, y) dy
        (b) \int_{A(x)} k(x, y) * f(y) dy
        (c) \int_{A(x)} k(x, y, f(y)) dy
        (d) \int_{A(x)} k(x, y, f(y)) * f(y) dy

    x : Points for which the output is defined
    y : Points for which the input is defined
    A(x) : A subset of all points y (depending on
           each x) over which to integrate
    k : A kernel parametrized as a MLP
    f : Input function to integrate against given
        on the points y

    If f is not given, a transform of type (a)
    is computed. Otherwise transforms (b), (c),
    or (d) are computed. The sets A(x) are specified
    as a graph in CRS format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mlp : torch.nn.Module, default None
        MLP parametrizing the kernel k. Input dimension
        should be dim x + dim y or dim x + dim y + dim f
    mlp_layers : list, default None
        List of layers sizes speficing a MLP which
        parametrizes the kernel k. The MLP will be
        instansiated by the MLPLinear class
    mlp_non_linearity : callable, default torch.nn.functional.gelu
        Non-linear function used to be used by the
        MLPLinear class. Only used if mlp_layers is
        given and mlp is None
    transform_type : str, default 'linear'
        Which integral transform to compute. The mapping is:
        'linear_kernelonly' -> (a)
        'linear' -> (b)
        'nonlinear_kernelonly' -> (c)
        'nonlinear' -> (d)
        If the input f is not given then (a) is computed
        by default independently of this parameter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y : torch.Tensor of shape [n, d1]
            n points of dimension d1 specifying
            the space to integrate over.
        neighbors : dict
            The sets A(x) given in CRS format. The
            dict must contain the keys "neighbors_index"
            and "neighbors_row_splits." For descriptions
            of the two, see NeighborSearch.
        x : torch.Tensor of shape [m, d2], default None
            m points of dimension d2 over which the
            output function is defined. If None,
            x = y.
        f_y : torch.Tensor of shape [n, d3], default None
            Function to integrate the kernel against defined
            on the points y. The kernel is assumed diagonal
            hence its output shape must be d3 for the transforms
            (b) or (d). If None, (a) is computed.
        weights : torch.Tensor of shape [n,], default None
            Weights for each point y proprtional to the
            volume around f(y) being integrated. For example,
            suppose d1=1 and let y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_{n+1}
            be some points. Then, for a Riemann sum,
            the weights are y_{j+1} - y_j. If None,
            1/|A(x)| is used.

        out_features : torch.Tensor of shape [m, d4]
            Output function given on the points x.
