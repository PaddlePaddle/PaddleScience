class FunctionalLoss(base.Loss):
    r"""Functional loss class, which allows to use custom loss computing function from given loss_expr for complex computation cases.

    Args:
        loss_expr (Callable): expression of loss calculation.
        reduction (Literal["mean", "sum"], optional): Reduction method. Defaults to "mean".
        weight (Optional[Union[float, Dict[str, float]]]): Weight for loss. Defaults to None.

    Examples:
        >>> import ppsci
        >>> import paddle.nn.functional as F
        >>> def loss_expr(output_dict, *args):
        ...     losses = 0
