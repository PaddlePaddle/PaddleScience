class FunctionalMetric(base.Metric):
    r"""Functional metric class, which allows to use custom metric computing function from given metric_expr for complex computation cases.

    Args:
        metric_expr (Callable): expression of metric calculation.
        keep_batch (bool, optional): Whether keep batch axis. Defaults to False.

    Examples:

        >>> import paddle
