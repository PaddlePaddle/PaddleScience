Welcome to PaddleScienceâ€™s documentation
=========================================

PaddleScience is SDK and library for developing AI-driven scientific computing applications based on PaddlePaddle. Current version is v0.1.

PaddleScience extends the PaddlePaddle framework with reusable software components for developing novel scientific computing applications. Such new applications include Physics-informed Machine Learning, neural network based PDE solvers, machine learning for CFD, and so on.

PaddleScience is currently under active development. Its design is evolving and its APIs are subject to change.


- **Core features and organization**

  PaddleScience currently focuses on the PINNs model. The core components are as follows.

  - Geometry, a declarative interface for defining the geometric domain. Automatic discretization is supported

  - PDE, delineating partial differential equations in symbolic forms. Specific PDEs derive the base PDE class. Two native PDEs are currently included: Laplace2d and NavierStokes2d.

  - Loss, defining what exact penalties are enforced during the training process. By default, the L2 loss is applied. In the current design, the total loss is a weighted sum of three parts, the equation loss, the boundary condition loss and the initial condition loss.

  - Optimizer, specifying which optimizer to use for training. Adam is the default option. More optimizers, such as BFGS, will be available in the future.

  - Solver, managing the training process given the training data in a batch fashion.

  - Visualization, an easy access to the graph drawing utilities.

  - The component organization is illustrated in the following figure.
