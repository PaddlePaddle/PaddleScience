Demo models
===========

Demo codes in the subdirectories show how to build and solve a PINN model using currently offerred APIs in this package.

---------
Solving a steady state 2-dimensional Laplacian equation in a rectangular domain.

2D Darcy
-------
Solving a Darcy flow problem in a 2-D setting.

2D LDC
-----
Solving a Lid Driven Cavity problem in rectangular domain.

2D unsteady circular cylinder
---------------------------------
Solving a 2-D unsteady cylinder flow with the PINN continuous method.

3D unsteady circular cylinder
---------------------------------
